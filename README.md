# Keras NN

One of the homeworks for the Artificial Intelligence course I took at UW-Madison the fall of 2020.

The goals of this homework were:

1. Get TensorFlow and Keras environment set up 
2. Implementing a neural network
3. Training the NN on the MNIST dataset
4. Evaluate the model's performance
